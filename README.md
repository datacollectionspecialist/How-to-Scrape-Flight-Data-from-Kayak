Launched in 2004, Kayak has become a widely-used travel search engine, helping travelers find the best deals on flights, hotels, car rentals, and vacation packages. By aggregating and comparing prices from numerous travel sites, Kayak enables users to book directly through providers or on its own platform. 

## Why Scrape Flight Data?
Flight data is extremely valuable in many fields, as follows:
- Travel planning: Accurate and real-time flight information can help the platform provide users with the latest travel information, so that users can book their trips at the most appropriate time.
- Price monitoring: By tracking flight prices over a long period of time, companies can identify price fluctuation trends and predict the best time for travelers to buy tickets.
- Market analysis: Historical flight data can reveal changing trends in consumer demand, popular travel periods, and pricing strategies, providing strong support for tourism industry analysts and market researchers.
## Is it legal to scrape Kayak's data?

### 3. Write the crawling code
Suppose we want to arrive at Berlin Brandenbury Airport from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, departing on March 1, 2025, and returning on March 4, 2025. Once we have the departure point, destination, departure date, and return date, we can form a complete parameter structure:
```



 input_data = {
        "departure_id": "CDG",
        "arrival_id": "BER",
        "data_type": 1,
        "outbound_date": "2025-03-01",
        "return_date": "2025-03-04"
    }
```
> **Parameter description:**
departure_id and arrival_id are the airport codes corresponding to the airports filled in, which are set by the International Air Transport Association.
>
> If you don't know the code of the corresponding airport, you can directly access Google Flights to get it in the departure and destination.
data_type represents our departure type, 1 represents Round trip.

![Write the crawling code](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/scrape-kayak/fa73f8d1991a494a08b7817898567e06.png)


After the parameters are formed, we can assemble the complete code, where you also need to **replace your_token with your Scrapeless API key:**
```



import json
import requests

class Payload:
    def __init__(self, actor, input_data):
        self.actor = actor
        self.input = input_data

def send_request():
    host = "api.scrapeless.com"
    url = f"https://{host}/api/v1/scraper/request"
    token = "your_token"

    headers = {
        "x-api-token": token
    }

    input_data = {
        "departure_id": "CDG",
        "arrival_id": "BER",
        "data_type": 1,
        "outbound_date": "2025-03-01",
        "return_date": "2025-03-04"
    }

    payload = Payload("scraper.google.flights", input_data)

    json_payload = json.dumps(payload.__dict__)

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json_payload)

    if response.status_code != 200:
        print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)
        return

    print("body", response.text)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    send_request()
```

Of course, our parameters are far more than that. We can also provide you with other parameters of [Google Flights](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/blog/scrape-google-flights?utm_source=official&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=scrapekayak), such as the number of passengers, number of stops, maximum price, etc. For details, you can refer to our [Scrapeless API official website documentation](https://apidocs.scrapeless.com/doc-796979?utm_source=official&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=scrapekayak).

### 4. How to export to CSV
If you need to export the results to CSV, just add the following code.
```

result = response.json()
best_flights = result['best_flights']

with open('flights-maps-results.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    csv_writer = csv.writer(csvfile)

    # Write the headers
    csv_writer.writerow(["departure_time", "arrival_time", "flight_number", "price"])

    # Write the data
    for best_flight in best_flights:
        flights = best_flight['flights']
        for flight in flights:
            departure_airport = flight['departure_airport']
            arrival_airport = flight['arrival_airport']
            csv_writer.writerow(
                [departure_airport["time"], arrival_airport["time"], flight["flight_number"], best_flight["price"]])

print('Done writing to CSV file.')


```
